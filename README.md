# Caregivers-and-House-Members-Platform
This project includes some basic SQL queries such as insert/delete/update operations with basic/complex queries and derived attributes. You can see the functionalities of buttons in the user interface via the file "Form1.cs". This file shows what these buttons do.

I connected my programme with a Microsoft SQL Server database which I've created beforehand.
I also created a copy of the database in MySQL. This was done for to use the latter database as a test database.
I know I still can improve user interface. There are other things that I can implement too.
