# Caregivers-and-House-Members-Platform
In this project I tried to create a platform as mentioned in the title.

I connected my programme with a Microsoft SQL Server database which I've created beforehand.

I also created a copy of the database in MySQL. This was done for to use the latter database as a guinea pig. (hope I do not offend anyone by using that phrase)

I still can improve user interface. There are other things that I can implement too.
